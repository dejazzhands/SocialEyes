            Start
        </div>
        <div id="step_1" class="step">
            Make sure you and your friends have agreed on a time and place to dine out. 
        </div>
        <div id="step_2" class="step">
            If you are going by yourself, arrive earlier and check for a table reservation under the group's name with the host.
        </div>
        <div id="step_3" class="step">
            Once everyone is seated and present, ask if everyone is ordering separately. If not, a member of the group will usually order large dishes to share, and you must go along with their choice. Otherwise, you can order as you please, waiting your turn.
        </div>
        <div id="step_4" class="step">
            Engage in conversation while waiting for food to arrive. Safe topics to discuss revolve around what the friend group have in common (for example, funny dorm experiences with college friends.)
        </div>
        <div id="step_5" class="step">
            Once the food is ready, start eating when everybody else does. Display proper table manners and do not talk while chewing. 
        </div>
        <div id="step_6" class="step">
            Try giving compliments about the food you are eating. This will prompt a conversation where everyone shares their opinions about the food, and shows your gratefulness to the person paying the bill if you are eating what they ordered.
        </div>
        <div id="step_7" class="step">
            If the group decided on splitting the bill, pay your share in full. Otherwise, thank the person who paid for the table and remind yourself to repay them with a similar favor another time.
        </div>

            That's it! Thanks for using SocialEyes. We hope this diagram could help you!
