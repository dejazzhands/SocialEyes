            If a family member is hosting a dinner party, make sure to bring a gift for the host. A bottle of wine or a bouquet of flowers is a good idea.
        </div>
        <div id="step_2" class="step">
            Give your present to the host when they first greet you. Ask them to be seated.
        </div>
        <div id="step_3" class="step">
            Take note of the relatives seated close to you so you can decide on appropriate conversation topics. For example, discuss school and toys 
            with little children and steer clear of explicit material.
        </div>
        <div id="step_4" class="step">
            Once everyone is present, the food would be ready and the host would motion the guests to eat.

        <div id="step_5" class="step">
            There are no set etiquette for family dinners, because it varies with different hosts. 
            However, it is important to not chew with your mouth open and not interrupt others when they are speaking.
        </div>
        <div id="step_6" class="step">
            In conversation, set boundaries around what questions you are comfortable answering. You can opt not to speak,
            divert the subject, or simply say "I don't want to talk about it."
        </div>
        <div id="step_7" class="step">
            Make sure that you've greeted every relative before the dinner ends, to signify that you acknowledge every member of the family. Thank the host
            for preparing the meal and planning the party, and compliment their food regardless of how you feel about it.
